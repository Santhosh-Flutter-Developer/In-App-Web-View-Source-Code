## üìö Usage
WebView Implementation
- The web view in this app is implemented using native Android and iOS WebViews, bypassing the need for plugins like webview_flutter.
- You can customize the URL, controls, and error handling logic as per your requirement.

## How It Works
1. Android: Uses WebView in the Android native layer.
2. iOS: Uses WKWebView in the iOS native layer.
Both platforms communicate via Flutter‚Äôs platform channels to manage the web view.

## Requirements
- Flutter SDK version 3.0.0 or later
- Android Studio / Xcode
